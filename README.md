4th project of Data Analyst Nanodegree, Explore and Summarize Data using R. 

In this project, a data set of red wine quality will be explored based on its physicochemical properties using the statistical software, R. The objective is to find physicochemical properties that distinguish good quality wine from lower quality ones. An attempt to build linear model on wine quality will also be shown.
